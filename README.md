# JUSTCOOK - HelloHacks 2025 Submission made by Verne, Aashir, Nicky, Alexis

_Students often struggle to balance health, cost, and time when cooking. We wanted to make it easier to eat well on a student budget — using what’s already in your fridge. Cooking is hard enough as it is, why not make the planning part easier?_

### What is Justcook?
JustCook generates recipes from ingredients you have, calculating calories, protein and dietary restrictions based on what's in your fridge. It can save favourite meals and add your own custom recipes — all stored locally for privacy and offline use.

The heart of JustCook is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla Javascript** with data stored via **localStorage**. The app uses modular design, recipe generation logic, and and even a mock API to serve recipe data as JSON.

### What's next for JustCook
We plan to integrate real nutrition APIs, the choice to share recipes with others, and AI-powered recipe generation later on. Our goal is to build a community of students sharing healthy, affordable meals — making cooking empowering instead of stressful.
